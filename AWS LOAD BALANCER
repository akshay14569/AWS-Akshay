What is an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?
An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a managed AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses, to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

What are the three types of Elastic Load Balancers available in AWS?
There are three types of Elastic Load Balancers: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB).

What is a target group in Elastic Load Balancing?
A target group is a logical grouping of targets (such as EC2 instances) registered with a load balancer. ALB and NLB use target groups to route requests to registered targets.

What is the main difference between Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB)?
ALB operates at the application layer and supports advanced routing, including content-based routing and path-based routing. NLB operates at the transport layer and provides ultra-low latency and high throughput.
