S3 - Theory
=====================

1. What is Amazon S3?
Ans: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

Minimum storage: 0 bytes
Maximum object size: 5 TB per object
Maximum total storage: Unlimited

2. What are storage types?
Ans: There are 4 types of storage:
     1. Simple Storage Service - S3
     2. Elastic Block Storage - EBS
     3. Elastic File Storage - EFS
     4. Glacier.

3. What are storage classes in S3?
Ans: There are 6 types of storage classes:
     1. S3 Standard
     2. S3 Standard Infrequent Access
     3. S3 One-Zone Infrequent Access
     4. S3 Intelligent Tiering
     5. S3 Glacier
     6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
1. S3 Standard offers high durability, availability and object storage for frequently accessed data.
2. S3 Standard IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
3. S3 One-Zone IA is for data that is accessed less frequently and data store in single AZ. 
4. S3 Intelligent Tiering is designed to optimized cost by automatically moving the data to the most effective access-tier.

4. What is S3 versioning?
Ans: S3 versioning is a feature that allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object in a bucket. It helps protect against accidental deletion and overwrites.

5. What is a pre-signed URL in S3?
Ans: A pre-signed URL is a URL that grants temporary access to an S3 object.

6. What is S3 Cross-Region Replication?
Ans: S3 Cross-Region Replication is a feature that automatically replicates objects from one S3 bucket in one AWS region to another bucket in a different region.

7. What is the purpose of S3 event notifications?
Ans: S3 event notifications allow you to trigger AWS Lambda functions or SQS queues when certain events, like object creation or deletion, occur in an S3 bucket.
