EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand.

EC2 Instance Types:
1. General purpose
2. Compute optimized
3. Memory optimized
4. Storage optimized
5. Accelerated computing

1. General purpose: General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers,
small databases, development and test environments, and more.

2. Compute optimized: Compute Optimized instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory. They excel in workloads that require high-performance processing such as batch processing, 
scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.

3. Memory optimized: Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory, such as in-memory databases,
real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.

4. Storage optimized: Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. 
They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.

5. Accelerated computing: Accelerated Computing Instances typically come with one or more types of accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). 
These accelerators offload computationally intensive tasks from the main CPU, enabling faster and more efficient processing for specific workloads.

2. What are types of EC2 Instances?
Ans: There are 5 types of instances:
      1. General Purpose
      2. Compute Optimized
      3. Memory Optimized
      4. Storage Optimized
      5. Accelerated Computing

1. General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources.
2. Compute Optimized instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory.
3. Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads.
4. Storage Optimized
3. EC2 Instances purchasing options
Ans: There are 6 types of purchasing options:
      1. On-Demand Instances
      2. Reserved Instances
      3. Spot Instances
      4. Dedicated Hosts
      5. Dedicated Instances
      6. Schedule Instances

1. On-Demand Instances is pay-as-you-go. It is used for short term irregular workloads. It will charge as per hour.
2. Reserved Instances you can reserved the instances from 1 year to 3 years by paying advance payment.
3. Spot Instances let you take adva
3. Spot Instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 Capacity in the AWS Cloud on discounted rate and you can bid on these instances as well.
4. Dedicated Hosts is a physical server with EC2 capacity fully dedicated to your use.
5. Dedicated Instances will run on dedicated servers and your instances are isolated from other instances.
6. Scheduled Instances allow you to reserve capacity for specific time windows that you define. These instances are available to you during the specified recurrin
